Multiple inheritance is a feature of some object-oriented computer programming languages 
in which an object or class can inherit features from more than one parent object or parent class.

In c++:
class A{}
class B{}
class C: public A, public B{

}

In python:
class A:
  pass
class B:
  pass:
class C(A,B):
  pass

In JAVA:
Note: Java doesnâ€™t support Multiple Inheritance
It will give Compilation Error.
