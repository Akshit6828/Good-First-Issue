Hierarchical Inheritance refers to the type of inheritance that has a hierarchical structure of classes. 
A single base class can have multiple derived classes, 
and other subclasses can further inherit these derived classes, forming a hierarchy of classes.


In c++:
class A{}
class B: public A{}
class C: public A{}

In python:
class A:
   pass
class B(A):
   pass
class C(A):
   pass

In JAVA:
class A{}
class B extends A{}
class C extends A{}
