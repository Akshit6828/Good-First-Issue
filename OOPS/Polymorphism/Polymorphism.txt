Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance.

Types of Polymorphism
  => Compile-time Polymorphism
  => Runtime Polymorphism

1. Compile-Time Polymorphism
This type of polymorphism is achieved by function overloading or operator overloading.

A. Function Overloading
Functions can be overloaded by changing the number of arguments or/and changing the type of arguments

B. Operator Overloading

2. Runtime Polymorphism
This type of polymorphism is achieved by Function Overriding. 
Late binding and dynamic polymorphism are other names for runtime polymorphism.

A. Function Overriding

Function Overriding occurs when a derived class has a definition for one of the member functions of the base class. 
That base function is said to be overridden.
