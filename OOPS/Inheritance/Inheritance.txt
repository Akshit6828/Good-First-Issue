Inheritance is a process in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of its parent object automatically. In such way, 
you can reuse, extend or modify the attributes and behaviors which are defined in other class.


Advantages:
1. Code reusability: We can reuse the members of the parent class. 
So, we don't need to define the member again and hence less code is required in the class.
2. Less development and maintenance expenses result from an inheritance. 

Syntax:
In c++:
class DerivedClass :: AccessModifiers BaseClass{

}

In python:
Class DerivedClass(BaseClass):
   {body}

In java:
class DerivedClass extends BaseClass {

}
