Multilevel inheritance is when a derived class inherits properties from a base class, and then another class inherits from that derived class.

In c++:
class A{}
class B: public A{}
class C: puclic B{}

In python:
class A:
  pass
class B(A):
  pass
class C(B):
  pass

In JAVA:
class A{}
class B extends A{}
class c extends B{
    has the properties of all the class.
}
